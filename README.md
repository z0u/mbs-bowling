## Keeping the Repository Small

Tips:

 - Don't apply subsurf modifiers.
 - Clear physics caches before saving.
 - Check file size before committing.
 - _Don't_ compress your `.blend` files - there's a lot of information that can be shared between them, and Git will take care of it.
 - Don't commit reference material; instead, link to it from a [Markdown] file like this one. For example, the image above is on wikimedia.org.


## 3rd-party Material

Only use resources that are compatible with CC BY-SA. For example, the bowling pin image above is CC0.
