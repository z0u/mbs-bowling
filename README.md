## Bowling Alley Tutorial

These are supporting files for [Melbourne Blender Society's][mbs] bowling alley tutorials.


## Keeping the Repository Small

Tips:

 - Don't apply subsurf modifiers.
 - Clear physics caches before saving.
 - Check file size before committing.
 - _Don't_ compress your `.blend` files - there's a lot of information that can be shared between them, and Git will take care of it.
 - Don't commit reference material; instead, link to it from a [Markdown] file like this one.


## 3rd-party Material
